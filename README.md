futureCorp Principles

futureCorp 101:

Leadership exists to serve you, in serving the customer.  
Who we ALL ultimately are.  
Read that again. Never forget it.

futureCorp 102:  

A still mind sets the course. Values chart the path.  
Thought fuels the journey. Action leads the way.  
Work leaves the impact.  
You are leadership now. Revisit 101.

futureCorp 103:  
The system adapts. But direction comes from within.  
Stillness sets the course. Awareness sets the speed.  
You are the pilot.  

futureCorp 104:  
Growth is not more. Growth is clearer.  
Stronger roots. Better questions.  
Sharper focus. Choose depth over noise.  
Move forward.  

futureCorp 105:  
Technology is a tool. Not the teacher.  
It follows. You lead.  
Stay awake. Build what matters.  
Check your course. Revisit 102.  

futureCorp 106:  
The customer is not a transaction. They are our reason.  
Our mirror. Our partner. They are us.  
Serve with care. Build with pride.  
Act with purpose.  

Now read it all one more time.
