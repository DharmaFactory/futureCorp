futureCorp Principles

futureCorp 101:

Leadership exists to serve you, in serving the customer.  
Who we ALL ultimately are.  
Read that again. Never forget it.

futureCorp 102:

A still mind sets the course. Values chart the path.  
Thought fuels the journey. Action moves the way.  
Work leaves the imprint.  
You are leadership now. Re-read 101.

Now read it all one more time.
